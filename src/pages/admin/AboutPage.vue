      <p>Starshifted is a Twitter inspired app made just for the users</p>
      <p>
        This app currently only has one developer only working on everything and
        hoping it is enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starshifted will be soon published for the people and hopefully it can
        satisfy the needs where Twitter fails.
